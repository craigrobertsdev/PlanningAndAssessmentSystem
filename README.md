## Motivation

Classroom teachers spend a significant amount of time doing lesson planning, recording assessment grades and making notes for report writing. 

They are also required to either create or source resources to supplement learning. 

The purpose of this app is to reduce the amount of time spent on repetitive tasks and to create lesson structures that can easily be modified and reused from year-to-year. 

## Problem Solved

This project aims to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Enable overviews of the school year, terms and individual weeks</li>
<li>Allow daily lesson planning with the ability to easily email that plan if the teacher is unwell and needs to provide notes for a reliever</li>
<li>Draw data from the Australian Curriculum and provide automatically generated headers based on learning outcomes for easy planning organisation</li>
<li>Enable teacher to keep records of grades and other administrative notes about each student</li>
<li>Automatically generate report comments based on grades</li>
</ul>

## Coming Soon
Further information about the project will be added (including link to deployed page), will be added as the project develops.
